TODO:
Add fetch data/ refresh data upon edit submit to show new log data
Make inputs required (creator, depth, duration, location)

Pages
Landing log in / sign up (Auth Auth)
Root posts - CREATE NEW, READ - shows all posts from people
Profile - READ - shows personal info and personal dives
Post display - UPDATE, DELETE - shows dive details in full - allows to edit, delete if yours (Auth/ Authent)

Forms
-Sign up
-Sign in
-New Log
-Edit Log
Should I add a seperate page for the new log? 

Landing Page/ Welcome
-Sign up or Sign in option
-Preview latest posts (maybe 5-10?)

Profile for users:
Name '', level '', num dives Number (then start counting from here - every new post increments this number by 1 - will decrement when deleting a dive), diveLog [{logs}], profile pic, location.
Profile page is their details and their logged dives only.
no need for contact details - could prefer privacy - add comments to logs? allow people to connect.

- Add lost password functionality?
- Add Authorization and Authentification for profiles. Can edit/ delete own posts only. (Using profile_ID or email for users?)


Future:
- Follow other divers
- Notifications?
- Search for Tags?
- Search for Locations, Divers, Dive Level?
- Weather conditions
- Dive locations
- Events/ Upcoming dives to join?
